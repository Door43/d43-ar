\v 18 Belteshazzar, that is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw in my dream. Now tell me what the dream means. No one else can tell me. \add I asked\add* all the very wise men in my kingdom to tell me what It means, but they were unable to do that.

\v 17 The holy ones in heaven have issued a decree. They want everyone to know that God Most High rules over all the kingdoms in this world. He is the one who chooses the people to rule these kingdoms. He sometimes places very unimportant people in places of importance."
\pi
\v 18 I said to Daniel, 'Belteshazzar, that is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw in my dream. Now you must tell me what the dream means. No one else can tell me. I asked all the very wise men in my kingdom to tell me what it means, but they were unable to do that. But you can tell me because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.'

\v 17 This decision is by the decree reported by the messenger. It is a decision made by the holy ones so that those who are alive may know that the most high God rules over the kingdoms of people and gives them to anyone he wishes to place over them, even the most humble man.'
\v 18 I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had this dream. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the men with wisdom in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you are able to do so, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
