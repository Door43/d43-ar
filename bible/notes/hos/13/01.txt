\v 1 Yahwehs says, "When the leaders of Israel spoke, the people trembled;
\q2 they were respected in Israel.
\q1 But because they all worshiped Baal, they became guilty, 
\q2 and they died.

\v 2 Now they sin more and more;
\q2 they make cast metal figures out of silver
\q1 to make them their idols.
